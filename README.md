# Integer and Linear Programming - SoluÃ§Ãµes ClÃ¡ssicas

This repository is dedicated to implementing the main solution methods for Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Using Python and/or Matlab.
The goal is to provide efficient and well-documented implementations of the most well-known algorithms, along with practical examples for each method.
